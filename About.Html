  <p>Big cats" and "wild cats" both belong to the family Felidae, but scientists distinguish them based on their genetics and ability to roar. While there are roughly 40 species of wild cats, only a handful are considered "big." 
Defining "Big Cats"
Technically, the term refers to members of the genus Panthera. The most common definitions include: 
The Roaring Cats: Only the Lion, Tiger, Leopard, and Jaguar can roar, thanks to a special ligament in their throats.
The Genus Panthera: This often includes the Snow Leopard, which is genetically a big cat but cannot roar.
Size-Based: In non-scientific contexts, large cats like the Cheetah and Cougar (Puma) are often grouped here, even though they belong to the "small cat" subfamily (Felinae) and can purr but not roar. 
The World of Wild Cats
Wild cats come in all sizes and live in diverse habitats, from deserts to snowy mountains. 
Small Wild Cats: These make up about 80% of all wild cat species. Examples include the Bobcat, Lynx, Ocelot, Serval, and Caracal.
Deadliest Small Cat: The Black-footed cat in Africa is the world's deadliest cat, with a 60% hunting success rate, despite its tiny size.
Ancient Roots: All domestic cats descend from the African wildcat (Felis lybica), which was domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago.
